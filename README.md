# This is a markdown text file
It's not code, it's plain text. You can document anything this way, from a quick note, through to writing a whole book.

You're welcome to edit this file to learn how the process works!

You can do formatting in markdown documents even though it's plain text. For example, by putting `**` around the next words: **this is now bold**.
